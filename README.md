# 100-days-of-swift

### Logs

**Day 27:** Today i learned a little about Capture lists in swift, and undertood the difference between weak, unowned and strong references, what they mean and how to write safe code preventing crashed and memory leaks

**Day 28** Today i learned a little about comparing strings and checking if a word is real, is possible, or it's letters are contained in another word. I also learned that in Swift you cant compare 2 strings with the == operator, just like booleans and numbers

**Day 29** Today i made a challenge that made me fix the content i learned in the past 2 days. It was about dealing with strings, checking it's length, and presenting errors to the user. I also solve a bug that the app treated words in a case-sensitive way

**Day 30** Today i started learning about how to do Auto layout directly in code. I now know that i can create horizontal and vertical stacks using a String to represent my elements, like this: 
```swift
"V:|[label1]-[label2]-[label3]"
```
The - represents a 10pt spacing

**Day 32** Today i learned the difference between widthAnchor, heightAnchor, topAnchor, bottomAnchor, leftAnchor, rightAnchor, leadingAnchor, trailingAnchor, centerXAnchor, and centerYAnchor. TrailingAnchor and leadingAnchor will flip in right-to-left languages. I also learned that i can use multiples and adding constants to constraints based on my main View

**Day 33** Today i learned about the Codable protocol, which automatically can parse data from a JSON to Swift objects

**Day 34** Today i learned a little about how to use tabBars and how AppDelegate and SceneDelegate works

**Day 35** Today i learned how to filter info in an array, and how to resize tableViewCell to word wrap and look nicer when displaying data.

**Day 36** Today i learned how to make a view entirely from code, and i found it really hard at first. A little confusing, specially for someone who already saw how SwiftUI is and really liked it

**Day 37** Today i learned about dealing with a lot of buttons and appending text to a textLabel, and again loading content from a file but using more complex separators to get all data needed for the game

**Day 38** Today i made the chalenge to draw a gray line around a UIView, adjusting it width, and rounding it corners

**Day 39** Today i learned more about Grand Central Dispatch and de Quality of Service queues, the user Interactive with highest priority, User initiated , Utility queue, for long tasks that user doesn't need right now, and the background queue. There is the default queue, bet

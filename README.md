# 100-days-of-swift

### Logs

**Day 27:** Today i learned a little about Capture lists in swift, and undertood the difference between weak, unowned and strong references, what they mean and how to write safe code preventing crashed and memory leaks

**Day 28** Today i learned a little about comparing strings and checking if a word is real, is possible, or it's letters are contained in another word. I also learned that in Swift you cant compare 2 strings with the == operator, just like booleans and numbers

**Day 29** Today i made a challenge that made me fix the content i learned in the past 2 days. It was about dealing with strings, checking it's length, and presenting errors to the user. I also solve a bug that the app treated words in a case-sensitive way

**Day 30** Today i started learning about how to do Auto layout directly in code. I now know that i can create horizontal and vertical stacks using a String to represent my elements, like this: 
```swift
"V:|[label1]-[label2]-[label3]"
```
The - represents a 10pt spacing

**Day 32** Today i learned the difference between widthAnchor, heightAnchor, topAnchor, bottomAnchor, leftAnchor, rightAnchor, leadingAnchor, trailingAnchor, centerXAnchor, and centerYAnchor. TrailingAnchor and leadingAnchor will flip in right-to-left languages. I also learned that i can use multiples and adding constants to constraints based on my main View

**Day 33** Today i learned about the Codable protocol, which automatically can parse data from a JSON to Swift objects

**Day 34** Today i learned a little about how to use tabBars and how AppDelegate and SceneDelegate works

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Animation"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/15/overview). This app is designed to teach me about using Core Animation. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Animation" app

**Day 1 - July 14, 2019**

It was a  pretty simple project that taught me about Core Animation. In addition to the app shown below, I also went back to Projects 2, 8, and 13 and add a few small animations.
